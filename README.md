# Cos2-Final

These are three of my best python projects since the start of the simester. All code is made by me.

1) JottoBotto
   JottoBotto is a computer program designed to help the user practice the game Jotto. Rules of the game 
   and useage of the bot are described inside the .py file upon running. Run the file inside the same folder 
   as words.txt

2) StatboticsElo
   This program is designed to download thousands of match results from First Robotics competitions around the
   world over multiple years, and run a standard ELO function on them. The program will iterate through every
   match since 2007 and keep track of each team's relative elo. Program will take ~14 minutes on school wifi.
   The output file is too large to upload to github, so see
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jKMGAUFiOnZRT2sKwTiD3RjbcjyhuYJ-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114358099046785782682&rtpof=true&sd=true
   for example output.

3) Scoutliers
   Scoutliers is a program I made for use at First Robotics competitions. The program takes an input file of
   raw data on performance of individual robots during the event, and output statistics used in the allience
   selection process. See 'Pine Tree Scouting - Week 3.xlsx' for example input file, and 'SlOutput.xlsx' for
   example output file.

Hope you enjoy the programs, and have a great summer !!
